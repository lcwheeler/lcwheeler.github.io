title: Papers (former pre-prints) officially published!

I previously posted [here](https://lcwheeler.github.io/2021-10-22-petunieae-preprint/) and [here](https://lcwheeler.github.io/2021-09-01-syndromes-preprint/) about two pre-prints that were released in 2021. The first was a perspective piece about studying syndromes in macroevolution and ecology. The second was a study of the molecular evolution of flower color genes in Petunia and its wild relatives. Both of these articles are now published in peer-reviewed journals.

title: Dissertation defended! 
---

On November 14th I defended my PhD dissertation at University of Oregon. It's great to be done, but a little bittersweet to be 
leaving the Harms lab. It's been a great five years here working with Mike, and I will miss the lab. However, I am also looking
forward to new things! I will be starting as a postdoctoral researcher at CU Boulder at the beginning of 2018.

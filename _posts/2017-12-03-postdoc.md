title: Starting a postdoc soon!
---

Very excited to announce that I will be starting as a postdoctoral researcher in January in the Smith group at CU Boulder. 
I will be working on dissecting the molecular mechanisms underlying the evolution of novel flower colors. This will be an 
amazing opportunity to learn more about evolutionary genetics and phylogenomics, while working to connect biochemical and
genetic changes to the evolution of complex phenotypes. Looking forward to new questions, a new field, and a new place!

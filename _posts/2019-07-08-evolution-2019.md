title: Evolution 2019
---

I recently traveled to Providence, Rhode Island for the Evolution 2019 meeting. I had the honor of giving a presentation, which was recorded and can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=py3jSv0BCgE). The conference was excellent! I had the opportunity to meet with collaborators, old friends, and other colleagues which led to many great conversations, and along with the many excellent talks, made the conference very much worth attending.

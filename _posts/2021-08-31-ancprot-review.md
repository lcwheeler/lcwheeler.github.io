title: Excellent third-party review of my dissertation work with Mike Harms
---


Chase Nelson, a postdoc at Academia Sinica in Taipei, recently wrote [this very concise review](https://inference-review.com/article/reconstructing-ancestral-proteins) of the last paper from my dissertation work with Mike Harms at the University of Oregon. He did a great job distilling the results and putting them into the broader context in a very readable way. Very cool!

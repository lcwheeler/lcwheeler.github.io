title: Good times at SICB 2019 in Tampa
---

I just got back to Colorado yesterday from a trip to present some of my postdoctoral research at the annual meeting of the 
Society for Integrative and Comparative biology. The other talks I attended were excellent and the diversity of topics on 
display was delightful!
 
Just prior to the meeting I put up a [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2019/01/03/511089) 
on bioRxiv of a new paper with my postdoctoral advisor; "Computational modeling of anthocyanin pathway evolution". It was 
awesome to get a chance to talk about this work to the SICB audience and have some good follow-up discussions. Looking forward
to attending again! 

Of course, I also took the opportunity to check out some interesting Florida wildlife.
